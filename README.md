## Rest API project


REST API for our application, visit (https://github.com/UrkoAT/pbl4server) to see the code. The client requires access to the database, and the API will be the handler for its petitions.


## Project description

One of the most significant problems in the business world is the lack of accuracy of
hours worked when using timecard systems, which can lead to inaccurate timekeeping and
incorrect payment of hours worked. To solve this problem, the CIC token system has been
created. This, with RFID technology, will register the entry and exit of workers to the company,
avoiding the incorrectness of the data. The company's information, including the tokens, will be
stored in a database for easy access. To support the system, a network topology has been
developed to support CIC. In addition, a method has been established to improve the estimation
of the hours needed for the projects developed in the company, performing for all these tasks
the analysis of the use cases to be fulfilled, as well as the design to be carried out. At the end of
the project, conclusions have been drawn regarding the development of the project, as well as
the future lines to be followed in case the company wishes to continue with the project.
